**I am recruiting *graduate* and *undergraduate* research assistants (esp. PhD). See [lab page](research/) for details.**

# Lab overview

Hi, I'm Jamie!
I am an Assistant Professor at Purdue University, in the Elmore Family School (department) of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE).

I lead the [Duality Lab](/research).
We study the engineering of software-intensive computing systems.
We are specifically interested in how software-intensive systems *fail* and how these failure modes can be mitigated.
We want to reduce the number of times that engineers repeat their mistakes.
Two values inform our research:
- We apply a "dual" socio-technical philosophy &mdash; high-quality systems must be engineered using both human and technical perspectives, and analysis of failures and mitigations must consider the engineered product as well as the underlying engineering process.
- We are *empiricists*; we strive to measure the practical impact of problems and solutions.

We publish our research in the premier venues for software engineering (ICSE, FSE, ASE) and cybersecurity (S&P, USENIX).

I am grateful to the sponsors of our research: the US National Science Foundation, Google, Cisco, Qualcomm, OpenAI, Socket, and Rolls Royce.

Use the links at the top to learn more about our activities.
